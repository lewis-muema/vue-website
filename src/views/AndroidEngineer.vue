            <p class="job-desc-head">Android Engineer</p>
            <p class="job-desc-par">The role is for someone who has experience in Android/Java development, and gets excited about building high-performing, scalable, consumer applications.<br><br>
                                    We believe in end-to-end ownership of projects. For any given project, we have one person on point. While they don't necessarily have to do all the work themselves, it's their job to make sure all the work gets done. We launch betas and prototypes as early as we can this helps ensure that we're building what users actually want.<br><br>
                                    We have a sticky notes wall and release a few times a week. We keep the team in sync with daily stand-ups and have a retrospective once a month to discuss things that are going well and opportunities for improvements. Although we have strong opinions, we're never afraid to try to new things to see if they work and reconsider our positions if the situation warrants it.</p>
